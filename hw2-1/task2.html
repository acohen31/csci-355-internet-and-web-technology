    <h1>Revelation</h1>
    <h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
    <p>We make ourselves a place apart <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind light words that tease and flout,<br>
           But oh, the agitated heart <br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Till someone find us really out.</p>
    <p>â€™Tis pity if the case require <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   (Or so we say) that in the end <br>
   We speak the literal to inspire <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The understanding of a friend.</p>

   <p>
    But so with all, from babes that play <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At hide-and-seek to God afar, <br>
    So all who hide too well away <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must speak and tell us where they are.
   </p>
